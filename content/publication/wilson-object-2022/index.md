abstract: Object geo-localization from images is crucial to many applications such
  as land surveying, self-driving, and asset management. Current visual object geo-localization
  algorithms suffer from hardware limitations and impractical assumptions limiting
  their usability in real-world applications. Most of the current methods assume object
  sparsity, the presence of objects in at least two frames, and most importantly they
  only support a single class of objects. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage
  technique that detects and geo-localizes dense, multi-class objects such as trafﬁc
  signs from street videos. Our algorithm is able to handle low frame rate inputs
  in which objects might be missing in one or more frames. We propose a detector that
  is not only able to detect objects in images, but also predicts a positional offset
  for each object relative to the camera GPS location. We also propose a novel tracker
  algorithm that is able to track a large number of multi-class objects. Many current
  geo-localization datasets require specialized hardware, suffer from idealized assumptions
  not representative of reality, and are often not publicly available. In this paper,
  we propose a public dataset called ARTSv2, which is an extension of ARTS dataset
  that covers a diverse set of roads in widely varying environments to ensure it is
  representative of real-world scenarios. Our dataset will both support future research
  and provide a crucial benchmark for the ﬁeld.
