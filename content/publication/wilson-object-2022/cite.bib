 abstract = {Object geo-localization from images is crucial to many applications such as land surveying, self-driving, and asset management. Current visual object geo-localization algorithms suffer from hardware limitations and impractical assumptions limiting their usability in real-world applications. Most of the current methods assume object sparsity, the presence of objects in at least two frames, and most importantly they only support a single class of objects. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage technique that detects and geo-localizes dense, multi-class objects such as trafﬁc signs from street videos. Our algorithm is able to handle low frame rate inputs in which objects might be missing in one or more frames. We propose a detector that is not only able to detect objects in images, but also predicts a positional offset for each object relative to the camera GPS location. We also propose a novel tracker algorithm that is able to track a large number of multi-class objects. Many current geo-localization datasets require specialized hardware, suffer from idealized assumptions not representative of reality, and are often not publicly available. In this paper, we propose a public dataset called ARTSv2, which is an extension of ARTS dataset that covers a diverse set of roads in widely varying environments to ensure it is representative of real-world scenarios. Our dataset will both support future research and provide a crucial benchmark for the ﬁeld.},
