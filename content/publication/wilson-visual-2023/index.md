abstract: The concept of geo-localization refers to the process of determining where
  on earth some `entity' is located, typically using Global Positioning System (GPS)
  coordinates. The entity of interest may be an image, sequence of images, a video,
  satellite image, or even objects visible within the image. As massive datasets of
  GPS tagged media have rapidly become available due to smartphones and the internet,
  and deep learning has risen to enhance the performance capabilities of machine learning
  models, the fields of visual and object geo-localization have emerged due to its
  significant impact on a wide range of applications such as augmented reality, robotics,
  self-driving vehicles, road maintenance, and 3D reconstruction. This paper provides
  a comprehensive survey of geo-localization involving images, which involves either
  determining from where an image has been captured (Image geo-localization) or geo-locating
  objects within an image (Object geo-localization). We will provide an in-depth study,
  including a summary of popular algorithms, a description of proposed datasets, and
  an analysis of performance results to illustrate the current state of each field.
