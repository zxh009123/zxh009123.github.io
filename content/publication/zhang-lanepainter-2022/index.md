abstract: For safety purposes, understanding the quality of the lane marks is essential
  for advanced driving technologies and pavement road maintenance. In practice, the
  performance of existing lane detection algorithms [1]â€“[3] struggles with lane marks
  in poor conditions, especially in rural areas where the lane marks are less maintained.
  However, enhancing the quality of lane marks is still not thoroughly studied. In
  this research, we collected a new public dataset to benchmark the performance of
  lane detection algorithms on various lane marks conditions from different rural
  areas in the U.S. Also, this paper proposed LanePainter, a Generative Adversarial
  Network (GAN) based model, which simultaneously enhances and assesses lane marks
  quality in street view images. To increase the detectability of lane marks, LanePainter
  enhances degraded lane marks of street view images directly on image pixels without
  affecting the high-quality lane marks. Our experiments demonstrated a substantial
  increase in the performance of current lane detection algorithms on low-quality
  lane marks after enhancing the images using our proposed LanePainter algorithm.
  Also, pavement maintenance can take benefit from our classification assessment method
  to quickly and accurately locate the regions with low-quality lane marks.
