abstract: The capability to generate clear and bright images in low light situations
  is crucial for photographers, engineers, and researchers. When it is not possible
  to modify the imaging conditions, an algorithm to enhance images is needed. Traditional
  methods require manually adjusting parameters to tune the image. Supervised learning
  methods need to collect a large amount of paired data for training. In this paper,
  we demonstrate an semi-supervised method for low light image enhancement, using
  a chain of cycle consistent generators. We show the effectiveness of our method
  by comparing it to existing image enhancement methods, both using standard image
  quality metrics and by using human perceptual judgements. We include an ablation
  study for features in our model. Our proposed method is computationally efficient
  and does not require paired training data.
