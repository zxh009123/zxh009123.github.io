abstract: The concept of geo-localization broadly refers to the process of determining
  an entityâ€™s geographical location, typically in the form of Global Positioning System
  (GPS) coordinates. The entity of interest may be an image, a sequence of images,
  a video, a satellite image, or even objects visible within the image. Recently,
  massive datasets of GPS-tagged media have become available due to smartphones and
  the internet, and deep learning has risen to prominence and enhanced the performance
  capabilities of machine learning models. These developments have enabled the rise
  of image and object geo-localization, which has impacted a wide range of applications
  such as augmented reality, robotics, self-driving vehicles, road maintenance, and
  3D reconstruction. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visual geo-localization,
  which may involve either determining the location at which an image has been captured
  (image geo-localization) or geolocating objects within an image (object geo-localization).
  We will provide an in-depth study of visual geo-localization including a summary
  of popular algorithms, a description of proposed datasets, and an analysis of performance
  results to illustrate the current state of the field.
